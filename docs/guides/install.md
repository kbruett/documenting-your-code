# Installation

To install the `randomly` package, clone the repository to your local machine, go to the repo directory, and use:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

```{tip}
The `.` at the end is the file path to the `randomly/` directory. Its a `.` because we are already in it. Otherwise, use the directory address.
```
